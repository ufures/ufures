## Hey my name's Luke! 😁

I'm a High School student who's learned some Python and Java through class courses.

One thing that I love about coding is that you can create anything you want as long as you have a clear vision, motivation, and discipline to work on a project until it's completion. By the end, the final product is hopefully satisfying😬

What I Created 💻
-

In my Junior year, I was learning Python and co-created this simple Hangman game on CodeHS: https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/hangman-the-sequal-iNk2F4/run

- It might not be the most optimized game, but it's fun and was my first go at creating something from scratch through coding. 😃👍

Now in my Senior year, I am learning Java as well as taking the capstone course where we develop our own software from scratch. What me and my group of 3 developed was a diet and lifting app named "LiftLab". 🍎💪

However, since we only had limited class time and basically little to no experience with Android Studio, (We wanted to make an app for our phones) we were only able to complete the diet side of our app. Here is the link to the github with all the files we wrote in Android Studio: https://github.com/Lift-Lab/Project-Final-In-Class-Version-.git

It might not look the prettiest, but the app is mostly functionable on the diet side like we planned.

Here's some cool features to look for in the app:

- Food Trackers to see if you've met your nutrition goals for the day
- Log Food function where you can update the trackers with any food you eat
- AI Chatbot (Blippy 🤖) that can help you with any diet questions you might have
- Set Diet Goal function so nutrition trackers adapt to any person

What I'm Doing Now 🚀
-
I might continue to work on LiftLab so I can get it to a place where I could use it in my daily life. 

However, I will be heading to the University of Alabama in the Fall where I plan to study Aerospace Engineering. I hope to bring my coding knowledge and apply it to systems that I will be developing in my engineering projects/courses.
